<h1> HTML Basics </h1>

Hi, my name will be linuxmaster-dev. Well, at least you can call me that.
Anyways, in this article, I will tell you the basics of HTML. If you are not 
familiar with this let me explain. HTML is a programming language used to build the stucture of a webpage.
See the title at the top of the page which says "HTML Basics?" The text was made bigger through HTML. This can
be achieved with the <h1> command. We will talk about this below. WAIT! DO NOT SCROLL DOWN YET! <strong> A very important thing in HTML is <!Doctype html>.</strong>
This command is used to idenify the HTML version. Without <!Doctype html>, the webpage may be displayed incorrectly. Now, let us get started.

                                                        <h3> Please Scroll Down </h3>
                                                        
                                                        
                                                        
                                                        
                                                        
                                                        
                                                        
                                                        
                                                        
                                                        
                                                        
                                                        
                                                        
                                                        
                                                        
                                                        
<h2>Some Basic HTML</h2>
HTML is very easy. It just takes some practice. Here are some basic HTML commands:

<!Doctype html>: This command is used for identifying the HTML version and must always go on line #1
<h1> Your Text Here </h1>: This command is used for making text big (Mostly used for titles)
<h2> Your Text Here </h2>: This command is used for making text big (Mostly used for titles also)
Eh... the numbers go on, you get it.
<noscript> Your Text Here </noscript>: If you build a webpage and include the <noscript> command, it will give you a message based on the text you put between
the command if JavaScript is disabled in your web browser.
<br>: This command places a line break between paragraphs
<p> Your Text Here </p>: This command is used for making a paragraph
<button> Your Text Here </button>: This command creates a button and this button displays the inputed text
<li> Your Text Here </li>: This command creates a list
